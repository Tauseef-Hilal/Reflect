# Contributing to this repository

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?


### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://github.com/Tauseef-Hilal/iCODE) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.


### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. 
- **TIP**: It's better to create a new branch for every issue/feature!

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you.
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out [git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole GitHub community thanks you. :sparkles:
